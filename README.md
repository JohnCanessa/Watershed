# Watershed
Experiment with the watershed algorithm from scikit-image using Python

The code in this repo has been edited from the PluralSight course 
Building Image Processing Applications Using scikit-image by 
Janani Ravi.

My approach is to read, experiment, and repeat as needed. I find
it as the best way to learn.

If interested in additional comments, I invite you to read
